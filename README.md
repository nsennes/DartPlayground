# FlutterPlayground
Welcome to my Flutter projects repository!ü•≥‚ú®Ô∏è 

This repository is dedicated to storing various Flutter applications and projects that I've developed for class assignments, self-study, and to gain a deeper understanding of the Flutter framework.

## Overview
In this repository, you'll find a collection of Flutter apps organized into different directories. Each directory corresponds to a specific project, class assignment, or topic that I've explored while learning Flutter.

## Project Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

### 1. Calculator_app

The Calculator App is my first self-study Flutter project, designed as an introductory exploration of Flutter's layout system, basic functionality implementation, and user interface design principles. This simple yet functional calculator app serves as a foundational project for studying Flutter's capabilities and gaining hands-on experience with app development.

<summary>Key Features</summary>

- Basic Arithmetic Operations: 
The calculator app supports essential arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- Clear and Intuitive Interface: 
The user interface of the app is designed to be clear, intuitive, and easy to use. Large, well-spaced buttons facilitate accurate input and minimize user errors.

- Real-Time Calculation: 
As users input numbers and operators, the calculator performs calculations in real-time, providing instant feedback and results.

<summary>Learning Objectives</summary>

- Layout Design:
By building the calculator app, I aimed to understand Flutter's layout system, including the use of rows, columns, and widgets to create responsive and adaptive UIs across different screen sizes and orientations.

- Package Integration:
Integrating the `math_expressions` package allowed me to explore the use of third-party packages in Flutter projects and leverage existing functionality to enhance app capabilities.

- User Interface Principles:
Through iterative design and refinement of the calculator app's user interface, I learned about UI design principles, including simplicity, consistency, and visual hierarchy.

  <summary>Upcoming Features</summary>

- Scientific Functions: In future iterations of the calculator app, I plan to implement advanced mathematical functions, such as square root, exponentiation, trigonometric functions, and more, building upon the foundation provided by the math_expressions package.

- Memory Functionality: Incorporating memory functionality, including memory storage and retrieval operations, will enhance the calculator app's utility for users performing complex calculations.
